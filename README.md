# Password-Generator-Project-for-Micro-IT
The Password Generator project is a Java application designed to generate strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. Users can customize the password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This ensures flexibility while promoting password strength and security.

The application demonstrates key concepts of Java programming, such as string manipulation, random number generation, conditional logic, and user input handling using the Scanner class. It's ideal for learning the importance of secure password creation and applying logic in a real-world use case.
